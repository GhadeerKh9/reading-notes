**What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team**

Google, in its race to build the perfect team, has perhaps unintentionally demonstrated the usefulness of imperfection and done what Silicon Valley does best: figure out how to create psychological safety faster, better and in more productive ways.

1. Who is Roy Fielding? He is the one who wrote the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because, the large majority of developers were busy writing layers of complex specifications for how to access data in a different way that isn't nearly as useful or eloquent, known as SOAP. Nouns weren't universal and verbs weren't polymorphic. They basically ignored throwing out decades of real field usage and proven technique and kept starting over with something that looks a lot like other systems that have failed in the past. They used HTTP but only because it let them talk to our network and security people less.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
   It is a protocol that’s capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world.

4. What does a GET do? Obtain all resources specified by the URL, using HTTP protocol

5. What does a POST do? It is used by systems to add somethings to other systems.

6. What does PUT do? It is used by systems to replace somethings from other systems.

7. What does PATCH do? It is used by systems to update somethings to other systems.

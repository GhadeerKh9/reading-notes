# Some Statements and Operators

## for statement
**A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.**

*A for statement looks as follows:*

*for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])statement*

## while statement
*A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. *



### Comparison operators
*A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values. In most cases, if the two operands are not of the same type, JavaScript attempts to convert them to an appropriate type for the comparison. This behavior generally results in comparing the operands numerically. The sole exceptions to type conversion within comparisons involve the === and !== operators, which perform strict equality and inequality comparisons. *



### Arithmetic operators
*An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. The standard arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). *




### Logical operators
*Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value. *

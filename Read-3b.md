 #### CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheets is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users and how they are styled.

*CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.
*

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
* *External CSS*
* *Internal CSS*
* *Inline CSS*

**CSS style sheet could be reset to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on.**

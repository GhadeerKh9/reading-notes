# JavaScript Functions
*A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.*

*A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).*



## JavaScript Function Syntax
*A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses.*

*Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).*

*The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)*

*The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets*


## Function Invocation
*The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

*When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)*
*When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code*
*Automatically (self invoked)*

## Why Functions?
*You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.*

*You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.*

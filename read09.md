#### A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.

The first command we are going to learn is pwd which stands for Print Working Directory. The command does just that. It tells you what your current or present working directory is.

 ## Terminal is an Extensionless System

 A file extension is normally a set of 2 - 4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is.

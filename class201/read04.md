WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

Declaring a function 
To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is known as function declaration.

Calling a function
Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code. 

Anonymous functions and functions expressions
Function declaration 
A function declaration creates a function that you can call later in your code. It is the type of function you have seen so far in this book.
Function expression 
If you put a function where the interpreter would expect to see an expression, then it is treated as an expression, and it is known as a function expression.

Variable scope
*Local variables*
 When a variable is created inside a function using the var keyword, it can only be used in that function. It is called a local variable or function-level variable.

*Global variables*
 If you create a variable outside of a function, then it can be used anywhere within the script. It is called a global variable and has global scope.

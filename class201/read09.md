# Form Controls

There are several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site.

* ADDING TEXT
* Making Choices
* Submitting Forms
* Uploading Files


## How Forms Work

* A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.

* The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.
* The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a database.
* The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.


Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside an element.
Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
 Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.
HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.



# Boxes

By default, a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.



**Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance.**

Border
Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.

Margin
Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.

Padding
Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box. 
* You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.

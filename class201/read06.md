A problem domain
A problem domain is the area of expertise or application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. A problem domain is simply looking at only the topics of an individual's interest, and excluding everything else.

What can you do about it?
If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:
1.	Make the problem domain easier
2.	Get better at understanding the problem domain
You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

JS Object Literals
 Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

In an object: variables become known as properties.
In an object: functions become known as methods.


Literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects.
You can access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation. And you can also access properties using square brackets.

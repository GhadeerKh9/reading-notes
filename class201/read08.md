## CSS Layout
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

Some CSS positions:
* Static Positions
* Relative Positions
* Absolute Positions
* Fixed Positioning: This is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element. Elements with fixed positioning do not affect the position of surrounding elements and they do not move when the user scrolls up or down the page

* Floating Elements:  Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box. The floated element becomes a block-level element around which other content can flow
### CSS Frameworks
CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.

## Advantages
They save you from repeatedly writing code for the same tasks.
They will have been tested across different browser versions (which helps avoid browser bugs).

## Disadvantages
They often require that you use class names in your HTML code that only control the presentation of the page (rather than describe its content).




**Things to keep in mind about CSS:**
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is  * about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

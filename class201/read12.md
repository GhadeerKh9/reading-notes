# Charts  


**Drawing a line chart**  

* To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart. 

* Next, we need to write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas.
Inside the same script tags we need to create our data, in this instance itâ€™s an object that contains labels for the base of our chart and datasets to describe the values on the chart.

# The <canvas> element

* Canvas is like img, but the mainly difference is that it has only two attributes, which are height and width.
* It requires a closing tag unlike the image element.

* Browsers that do support <canvas> will ignore the content inside the container, and just render the canvas normally.


# Drawing Rectangles

**These functions are used to draw rectangles on the canvas:**
* fillRect(x, y, width, height): Draws a filled rectangle.
* strokeRect(x, y, width, height): Draws a rectangular outline.
* clearRect(x, y, width, height) : Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.


**Drawing path**

**functions used to create paths:**

* beginPath() : Creates a new path. Once created, future drawing commands are directed into the path and used to build the path up.
* Path methods: Methods to set different paths for objects.
* closePath(): Adds a straight line to the path, going to the start of the current sub-path.
* stroke(): Draws the shape by stroking its outline.
* fill(): Draws a solid shape by filling the path's content area.

## Colors:


**color is a string representing a CSS <color>, a gradient object, or a pattern object.**

**properties we can use to apply colours to a shape:**

* fillStyle = color : Sets the style used when filling shapes.
* strokeStyle = color: Sets the style for shapes' outlines.

## When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page
Some Markups are:
* Structural Markup
* Semantic Markup which are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages.

## CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

*A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.*
*Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.*

## Compiling

Java is a compiled language, meaning there is a program that’s responsible for converting the language we use when we write Java into machine languages (1s and 0s), so that the computer can understand it. The opposite of compiling languages is interpreted languages such as JavaScript.

## Application Programming Interface

Java has a standard Application Programming Interface —a huge library consisting of over 4,000 classes, each with its own functionality, its own limitations, and its own rules for effective use.

One can search and look for the methods and the classes they want to read about from the API documentation at docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/.
You can serach in a different ways, one of them by the index, using the search dialogue box of the browser and choosing the required method or class.

## Jvadoc

Jvadoc program which is usually installed with JDK uses lines from code to create documentation. So, almost everyone’s’ documentations look similar to each other and to the standard API documentation.
